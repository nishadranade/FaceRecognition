# FaceRecognition
Final Project for CS 682

Current Plan - 

Baseline - 
Either PCA or Simple Deep Neural network


Use Autoencoders (more than one, stacked) to learn features of Yale Faces
Check accuracy
Also figure out decoder

Then use a variational autoencoder and try to generate new samples, and after that attempt face synthesis

Dataset - Every identity has 11 images associated with it, so can split training - test as 8 - 3, and then further split the training set into training - validation as 6 - 2
